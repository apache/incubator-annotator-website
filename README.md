# Apache Annotator (incubating) Website

The site is currently in static HTML hosted out of the `content/` directory.

Any pre-generated/rendered content or documentation should be added to additional
folders in the root of this repo.

## Publishing

Currently, `master` and `asf-site` should be kept in sync. The `asf-site`
branch gets published to an Apache HTTPD static hosting environment run by
the Apache infrastructure team.
